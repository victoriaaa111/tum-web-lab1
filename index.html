        <h3>Bachelor's Degree in Software Engineering</h3>
        <p><i>Technical University of Moldova </i> | <i>Sept 2023 - June 2027 (expected)</i></p>
        <p>During my studies, I really enjoyed the <b>Object-Oriented Programming</b> and <b>Databases</b> courses, as they helped me understand how real applications are structured and how data is managed efficiently.
            I liked doing the laboratory works and these courses made learning more practical and motivated me to build complete projects.</p>
